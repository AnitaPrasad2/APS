* comparision of space and time complexity between Lookup table technique, Square root decomposition and segment tree

1.Lookup table technique: 
    Space and time require to generate lookup table is O(n^2). 
    Time require to fetch data at best case is O(1) and at worst case is O(n).
    
2.SegmentTree :
    This is a bottom up binary tree. Suits only when values are static.
    Time complexity to access data is O(log n).
    Space complexity is O(n).
      
3.Square root Decomposition : 
    Space complexity is O(n).
    Time complexity is O(n).
    Access time complexity is O(sqrt n).
