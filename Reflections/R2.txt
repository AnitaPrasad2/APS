* comparision of space and time complexity between Lookup table technique, Sqrt decomposition and segment tree

1.Lookup table technique: 
    Space and time requirre to generate lookup table is O(n^2). 
    Time require to fetch data at best case is O(1) and at worst case is O(n).
    
2.SegmentTree :
    This is a bottom up binary tree. Suits only when values are static.
    Time complexity is O(log n) and space complexity is O(n).
       
3.Sqrt Decomposition : 
    Access time complexity is O(sqrt n).
